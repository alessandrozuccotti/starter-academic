abstract: "In this work we are going to study wormhole solutions in Einstein-Weyl
gravity. Such solutions emerge when looking for a static spherically symmetric metric in the vacuum, 
in the more general context of classical quadratic
gravity. Classical quadratic gravity is the theory of gravitation that comes out
when including quadratic terms in the curvature in the Einstein-Hilbert action
of general relativity. The study of such theory is motivated by the presence
of quadratic corrections in almost all attempts to nd a consistent description
of quantum gravity. Indeed, it is well known that general relativity can be
consistent as a quantum eld theory only as a low-energy effective theory. We
are not going to discuss the quantum aspects of the quadratic action: instead,
we consider what happens to the classical description of the space-time when
quadratic corrections are taken into account. In order to do that, we restrict
to the simplest non-trivial case, that is a static spherically symmetric space-
time in the vacuum. Given these restrictions in general relativity, we have
the well known Schwarzschild solution, i.e. black hole solution. In classical
quadratic gravity the Schwarzschild solution is still present, but we can also
nd many different classes of solutions: the aim of this thesis is to classify
the various solutions families, as well as to characterize a specific family that
covers a large part of the solution space, i.e. wormhole solutions. We solve the
geodesic equation in such solutions which shows the reason why we call them
traversable wormholes. We report all the solution families found in previous
works while adding a new subfamily of the generic wormhole solutions.
When studying different classes of solutions we are assisted by a Lichnerowicz-
type theorem which removes the contributions of the R2 term from the equations of 
motion under some assumptions, in particular when an horizon is
present. When such contribution is absent, the quadratic theory reduces to
Einstein-Weyl gravity.
By numerically solving the equations of motion in the Einstein-Weyl theory,
we classify the various solution families in a phase diagram of the theory. By
using the shooting method for the boundary value problem between spatial
infinity and the radius of the wormholes, we nd the geometric properties
of the wormhole solutions, and in particular we characterize the behavior of
these solutions in function of their position on the phase diagram. Then we
use the results to explore both the interior r < r0 of the wormholes and the
new copy of r > r0 that emerges in such solutions. We report a qualitative
analysis of the behavior of the metric in this new r > r0 region, discovering
that it has a finite proper volume for r -> inf for almost all solutions, due
to a strongly non-at behavior of the metric. We conclude with a physical
discussion about the case of a massive observer that falls into these solutions."
