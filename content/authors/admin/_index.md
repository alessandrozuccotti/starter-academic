I currently live in Pisa and I got a Master Degree in Theoretical Physics  ["@E. Fermi" Physics department](https://www.df.unipi.it/en/content/generic/111125/benvenuto), University of Pisa. During my studies I gained deep expertise in gravitation, General Relativity, blackhole and wormhole solutions.
